# Kowel: A Historical Gem in the Heart of the Volhynian Region

## Location

Situated since 1794 as a county town in the Volhynian province, Kowel is beautifully positioned on the banks of the Turia River. Strategically placed along the Kiev-Brest highway, it also serves as the junction point of the Vistula Railway and the Kiev-Brest Railway.

## Population & Development

With the introduction of the railway, Kowel has witnessed rapid growth in both its population and trade. As of now, it boasts a population of 15,000, with the official statistics of 1881 recording a count of 4,675. The town spreads across an area of 3,000 deciatines. Interestingly, a significant portion of its Christian townsfolk are engaged in agriculture.

## History

The historical roots of Kowel trace back to 1518 when it was owned by the Sanguszko princes. It was during this time that King Zygmunt I granted it the privilege of becoming a small town based on Magdeburg law. The town later became a royal domain after Queen Bona acquired it. Notably, the Moscow emigrant Prince Kurbski was granted the town for his lifetime in 1564. However, he was known for his rebelliousness, which is evident from the official records.

Kowel has always been an essential point for river crossings over the Turia, especially for travelers moving from Lithuania to Rus. Historical traces suggest that before the Tatar invasion led by Batu Khan, a monastery and cemetery existed here. The monastery eventually moved deeper into the woods, to an island on the Turia where the village of Wierbka now stands.

## Religious Institutions

A notable structure in Kowel is the wooden Catholic Church of St. Anna, built in 1854 through local contributions. The Kowel deanery, part of the Łuck-Żytomierz diocese, comprises 10 parishes.

## Economic Activities

The town is home to 11 factories that employ 52 workers and produce goods worth 13,651 rubles. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the residents, with potato cultivation being predominant.

## Geography

Geographically, the Kowel district is part of Polesia, characterized by its low-lying, marshy lands. There are several lakes scattered throughout the region, particularly amidst forested swamps. The district is blessed with rivers like the Wyżwa, Turia, and Stochod, providing picturesque landscapes for visitors.

## Conclusion

Kowel, with its rich history, serene landscapes, and vibrant culture, is a must-visit destination for those looking to explore the hidden treasures of the Volhynian region.
