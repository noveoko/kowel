# Cross-Perspective Image Matcher

A Python application that finds corresponding pixels between aerial and street view photographs using a combination of traditional computer vision techniques and deep learning approaches.

## Features

- Deep feature extraction using pretrained ResNet50
- SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) feature matching
- FLANN-based matching for efficient feature comparison
- Similarity score computation between different perspectives
- Visual match highlighting and result visualization
- Support for various image formats

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended for better performance)

### Dependencies
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python torch torchvision pillow matplotlib
```

For GPU support, ensure you have the appropriate CUDA toolkit installed and install the GPU version of PyTorch:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cross-perspective-matcher.git
cd cross-perspective-matcher
```

2. Place your images in the project directory:
   - `aerial_photo.jpg`: Top-down aerial photograph
   - `street_view_photo.jpg`: Street-level photograph

3. Run the script:
```bash
python perspective_matcher.py
```

### Using as a Module

```python
from perspective_matcher import CrossPerspectiveMatcher

# Initialize the matcher
matcher = CrossPerspectiveMatcher()

# Load your images
aerial_photo = cv2.imread('aerial_photo.jpg')
street_view_photo = cv2.imread('street_view_photo.jpg')

# Find correspondences
results = matcher.find_correspondences(aerial_photo, street_view_photo)

# Access results
similarity_score = results['similarity_score']
num_matches = results['num_matches']
visualization = results['visualization']
```

## How It Works

1. **Deep Feature Extraction**
   - Utilizes a pretrained ResNet50 model
   - Extracts high-level features from both images
   - Computes similarity scores between perspectives

2. **SIFT Feature Matching**
   - Detects keypoints and descriptors using SIFT
   - Matches features using FLANN
   - Filters matches using ratio test

3. **Visualization**
   - Draws corresponding points between images
   - Shows matching lines connecting features
   - Displays similarity metrics

## Output

The program provides:
- Similarity score between images (0-1 scale)
- Number of matching points found
- Visualization of matching points between images
- Keypoint coordinates for both images
- Match quality metrics

## Future Improvements
