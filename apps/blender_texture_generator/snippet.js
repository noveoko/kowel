    return `Studio overhead shot of a ${value} surface in perfect 8K monochrome, captured with a professional ring light creating a smooth and gradual circular gradient falloff. The central 70% displays crystal-clear ${value} details with a 10x10 visible pattern of elements. The texture transitions seamlessly to pure black at the edges with no white artifacts, no sharp falloff, and no visible edge lighting. The fade is soft and gradual, maintaining a natural and uninterrupted look for museum-grade material photography with extreme detail preservation.`
